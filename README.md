# Vnyan-Stuff
Various assets I've created for the Vnyan application by Suvidriel: https://suvidriel.itch.io/vnyan

These are the nodegraphs I've created to supprt my twitch stream for the Vnyan program!

There's A LOT here to unpack- graphs cover things from automation tasks, to user rdeems, chat commands, model effects and swapping, and so much more. that vast majority of these nodes will not work out of the box and rely on specific asset files that were not created by me and that I cannot share directly...however, they do give a good idea of the logic required to make everything work.

I'm in the process of documenting everything that's happening here, and it reamins under active development. Check back infrequently to grab the latest updates!
